The\n      primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n      registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n      why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n    \n      Terminology\n      -----------\n    \n      - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n      - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n      - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n      - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n      - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n      - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n    \n      A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n    \n      Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n      state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n      rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n    \n      Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n      promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n      settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n      itself fulfill.\n    \n    \n      Basic Usage:\n      ------------\n    \n      ```js\n      let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n        // on success\n        resolve(value);\n    \n        // on failure\n        reject(reason);\n      });\n    \n      promise.then(function(value) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Advanced Usage:\n      ---------------\n    \n      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n      `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n    \n      ```js\n      function getJSON(url) {\n        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n          let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    \n          xhr.open('GET', url);\n          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n          xhr.responseType = 'json';\n          xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n          xhr.send();\n    \n          function handler() {\n            if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n              if (this.status === 200) {\n                resolve(this.response);\n              } else {\n                reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n              }\n            }\n          };\n        });\n      }\n    \n      getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n    \n      ```js\n      Promise.all([\n        getJSON('/posts'),\n        getJSON('/comments')\n      ]).then(function(values){\n        values[0] // => postsJSON\n        values[1] // => commentsJSON\n    \n        return values;\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      @class Promise\n      @param {function} resolver\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @constructor\n    */\n    function Promise(resolver) {\n      this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n      this._result = this._state = undefined;\n      this._subscribers = [];\n\n      if (noop !== resolver) {\n        typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n        this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n      }\n    }\n\n    Promise.all = all;\n    Promise.race = race;\n    Promise.resolve = resolve;\n    Promise.reject = reject;\n    Promise._setScheduler = setScheduler;\n    Promise._setAsap = setAsap;\n    Promise._asap = asap;\n\n    Promise.prototype = {\n      constructor: Promise,\n\n      /**\n        The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n        which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n        reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n      \n        ```js\n        findUser().then(function(user){\n          // user is available\n        }, function(reason){\n          // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n        });\n        ```\n      \n        Chaining\n        --------\n      \n        The return value of `then` is itself a promise.

The\n      primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n      registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n      why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n    \n      Terminology\n      -----------\n    \n      - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n      - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n      - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n      - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n      - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n      - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n    \n      A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n    \n      Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n      state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n      rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n    \n      Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n      promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n      settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n      itself fulfill.\n    \n    \n      Basic Usage:\n      ------------\n    \n      ```js\n      let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n        // on success\n        resolve(value);\n    \n        // on failure\n        reject(reason);\n      });\n    \n      promise.then(function(value) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Advanced Usage:\n      ---------------\n    \n      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n      `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n    \n      ```js\n      function getJSON(url) {\n        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n          let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    \n          xhr.open('GET', url);\n          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n          xhr.responseType = 'json';\n          xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n          xhr.send();\n    \n          function handler() {\n            if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n              if (this.status === 200) {\n                resolve(this.response);\n              } else {\n                reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n              }\n            }\n          };\n        });\n      }\n    \n      getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n    \n      ```js\n      Promise.all([\n        getJSON('/posts'),\n        getJSON('/comments')\n      ]).then(function(values){\n        values[0] // => postsJSON\n        values[1] // => commentsJSON\n    \n        return values;\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      @class Promise\n      @param {function} resolver\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @constructor\n    */\n    function Promise(resolver) {\n      this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n      this._result = this._state = undefined;\n      this._subscribers = [];\n\n      if (noop !== resolver) {\n        typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n        this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n      }\n    }\n\n    Promise.all = all;\n    Promise.race = race;\n    Promise.resolve = resolve;\n    Promise.reject = reject;\n    Promise._setScheduler = setScheduler;\n    Promise._setAsap = setAsap;\n    Promise._asap = asap;\n\n    Promise.prototype = {\n      constructor: Promise,\n\n      /**\n        The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n        which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n        reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n      \n        ```js\n        findUser().then(function(user){\n          // user is available\n        }, function(reason){\n          // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n        });\n        ```\n      \n        Chaining\n        --------\n      \n        The return value of `then` is itself a promise.
